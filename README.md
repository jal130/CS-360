Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  This app was designed to allow users to create and edit items in an inventory list. It was deisnged to business owners and caual users. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  The app includes a login scree, a main inventory screen, and a category screen. The design was created to be simple and easy for a user to use. I think the designs were successfull 
  because the app is intuitive and easy to use.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  The app was apprached by designing the user interface first, and then creating the backend logic afterwards. I think this can be a good way to work, but in the future, I will 
  probably consider the back end logic more when designing the user interface so that I don't end up going back to do any redesigns.

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  I tested the code by running it and entering inputs to see if I got the expected results. This is important because sometimes when changes are made, it can affect other parts of the
  app unintentionally and its imporant to consistently make sure all of the functionality is still correct. 

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  I had to innovate by being flexible to redesign as the devlopment progressed. 
  
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  One specific component that was particulary successful was the ability to edit items in the inventory.
